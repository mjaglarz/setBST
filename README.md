Implementation of Set on my own BST in C++ 
============================
* on templates
* with copy/move constructors and assignment operators
* with custom forward iterator (using function to find parent of a node)

## Operations:
- insertion 
- deletion
- find (iterative - returning an iterator and recursive)
- iterators to begin and end
- size/empty
- print (overloaded output operator)

## Operations for custom iterator:
- comparison operators
- dereference operators
- preincrement and postincrement
- overloaded operator bool
